        for my two-year old for her iPod. They are absolutely adorable, and work as
        described. I noticed she had the volume all the way up on her iPod, but the
        headphones were not blasting; they remained at a normal volume for her little
        ears. I HIGHLY recommend these!","submissionTime":"2012-12-28T20:37:59","title":"Perfect!","upVotes":"6","downVotes":"0"},{"name":"Disney

        actually wore them for awhile and they are very comfortable. The volume restiction
        on them is not an issue either they still are plenty loud for adults or kids.
        My oldest daughter whom is 16 loves them. We also have a pair of the monsters
        inc. ones as well and they are just GREAT!!! I would recommend these to kids
        of any age. I mean why not wear characters that you like be yourself and have
        fun that''s what I always tell my kids. Seriously they are very good quality
        for the price and comfortable. So buy a pair or more and and have fun!!!!","submissionTime":"2013-12-06T06:06:50","title":"Ecxcellent

        3 year old granddaughter loves these headphones and I get a kick out of seeing
        her with that big pink bow on her head as she watches her shows on her pink
        DVD player.\nShe was excited when she first saw the headphones. The ear parts
        are soft for her little ears and it fits just right on her little head. It
        also has room for adjustments for older kids, but its not too big. She was
        wearing adult ones before and I had to keep adjusting them because they were
        not made for children. We love these things! It''s a good buy.","submissionTime":"2013-11-13T05:46:57","title":"Great
